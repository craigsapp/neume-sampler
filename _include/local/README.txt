Running the website locally without the internet.
=================================================

Type `make` to download the current state of the metadata for the
spreadsheet.  This allows you to run the website locally on your
computer without an internet connection (useful for travel, for example).

This will download the main page index from the spreadsheet (in
JSON format), and then this index will be read for non-hidden
worksheets for various categories of images.
